This is a repository to hold the interface implementation of the [IEX cloud api](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api) in postman. More info on postman can be found [on their home page](https://www.getpostman.com/). This repository is ment to aid in developing tools that use IEX api by giving direct access to the endpoints in a way that a developer could experiment with.
